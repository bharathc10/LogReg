# Logistic Regression Model from Scratch

This project is a demonstration of a logistic regression model implemented from scratch in Python. The purpose of this project is to showcase my understanding of logistic regression by creating a simple, custom implementation and applying it to the Diabetes dataset.

## Data

The dataset used for this project is the Diabetes dataset from scikit-learn. It contains ten baseline variables such as age, BMI, blood pressure, etc., as well as a target variable indicating the presence of diabetes.

- Data Source: [Diabetes dataset on scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html#diabetes-dataset)

## Implementation

The key components of the implementation are as follows:

- Sigmoid Function
- Cost Function (Log-Likelihood)
- Gradient Descent
- Prediction

The code for the logistic regression model can be found in the [diabetes.ipynb](diabetes.ipynb) file.

## Results

After running the model, you will see the model's accuracy on the Diabetes dataset and the corresponding visualization of the decision boundary.

Here are some example results you can expect:

```
Model accuracy: 0.766
```
## Dependencies

This project relies on the following Python libraries:

- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn (for data loading)

You can install these dependencies using the provided [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file.
